## Background

The [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) in [Alexandria, Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Egypt "Alexandria, Egypt"), was one of the largest and most significant [libraries of the ancient world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_libraries_in_the_ancient_world "List of libraries in the ancient world"). Alexandria was considered the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library. The library was part of a larger research institution called the [Musaeum of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeum "Musaeum"), where many of the most famous thinkers of the ancient world studied.

The burning of the Library of Alexandria, including the incalculable loss of ancient works, has become a symbol of the irretrievable loss of public knowledge.

This repository is an attempt to rebuild a digital version of this library for everything blockchain related.
